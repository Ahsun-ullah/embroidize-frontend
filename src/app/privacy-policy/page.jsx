                We also collect certain types of information that do not
                directly identify you as an individual. This non-personally
                identifiable data is gathered automatically based on your
                interactions with our website and may be analyzed both
                individually and in aggregate.
              </p>
              <p>
                For instance, we may track details such as the webpage you
                visited before arriving at our site, the page you visit next,
                your web browser type, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
              </p>
              <p>
                A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) refers to the web address of a
                page or resource online. An IP address is a unique number
                assigned to your device whenever you access the internet. These
                identifiers help websites communicate with your device and are
                necessary for web browsing and online shopping.
              </p>
              <p>
                This type of information helps us understand user behavior,
                improve website performance, and enhance your overall experience
                on our platform

                improve site functionality, and manage our internal systems more
                efficiently.

                reporting of non-personal information to our partners. Details
                we may gather include the referring URL, domain type (e.g., .com

                selections, payment details, order reference, IP address, and
                login credentials. This data allows us to fulfill your order,
                manage royalty or license obligations, maintain site operations,
                and provide marketing communication. Downloadable content may

                To help us improve our services, we may invite customers to
                complete voluntary surveys. These may be conducted internally or
                by a third party. While individual responses remain

              <p>
                When you participate in giveaways, contests, or other
                promotions, we may request personal information such as your
                name, address, and email. This information is used to manage the
                promotion, notify winners, and—where legally required—publicly
                disclose winners. Participation implies consent to receive
                promotional content related to the contest. You may also be
                required to submit eligibility documentation to claim prizes.

                contact forms—we may retain a record of the communication. This
                helps us track support issues and improve service quality. If
                third parties contact us regarding your use of our site, we may
                also retain that correspondence for reference.

            <Section title='Advertising'>
              <p>
                We may display advertisements on our website tailored to user
                interests. This allows us to deliver relevant promotions based
                on your browsing behavior. Advertisers do not have access to
                your personal information. We may use aggregated,
                non-identifiable data to help advertisers target appropriate
                audiences. For example, we may include an advertisement in a
                marketing email to customers who have shown interest in a
                relevant product category.

                understand customer preferences. Aggregated usage statistics may
                be shared with business partners or third parties.
